### Your professional pitch: Youâ€™ve done a recording, so just write down here how it goes.

Hey! I'm Dave Robertson. I'm a 13 Year active duty US Army Veteran and I currently serve in the national guard. I have experience in risk management, cyber security, and most recently in software development. Currently I'm a security engineer focusing on data loss and prevention at the veterans adminstration, though I'm interested in roles that allow me to use my newly acquired software engineering skills. I'm a voracious learner and I love using new technologies and meeting new people. THat's always kind of been my thing. Additionally I've worked in the cleared space for a long time, so I'm very up to speed when it comes to security and being a trust worthy individual. So hit me up.

### What excites you the most about tech? Write 1-2 sentences.
The two biggest things are remote work and actually making something. The ability to create on the go; exploring my own creativity and from anywhere in the world is amazing.
